[00:00.69] Lily was a little girl
[00:03.32] Afraid of the big, wide world
[00:06.24] She grew up within her castle walls
[00:23.74] 
[00:12.98] Now and then she tried to run
[00:15.45] And then on the night with the setting sun
[00:18.63] She went in the woods away
[00:21.03] So afraid, all alone
[00:31.03] 
[00:25.98] They've warned her, don't go there
[00:29.35] There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
[00:32.55] Then something came creeping
[00:35.77] It told her
[00:41.27] 
[00:37.32] "Don't you worry, just
[00:38.61] Follow everywhere I go
[00:40.81] Top of all the mountains or valley low
[00:43.94] Give you everything you've been dreaming of
[00:47.16] Just let me in, ooh"
[00:51.12] "Everything you want in gold
[00:53.62] I'll be the magic story you've been told
[00:57.03] And you'll be safe under my control
[00:59.81] Just let me in, ooh"
[01:09.81] 
[01:12.67] Just let me in, ooh
[01:22.17] 
[01:16.62] She knew she was hypnotized
[01:19.53] And walking on cold thin ice
[01:22.53] Then it broke, and she awoke again
[01:39.53] 
[01:29.68] Then she ran faster and
[01:32.95] Start screaming, "Is there someone out there?
[01:36.19] Please help me, come get me"
[01:39.34] Behind her, she can hear it say
[01:54.84] 
[01:42.19] "Follow everywhere I go
[01:44.47] Top of all the mountains or valley low
[01:47.68] Give you everything you've been dreaming of
[01:50.78] Just let me in, ooh"
[01:54.70] "Everything you want in gold
[01:57.53] I'll be the magic story you've been told
[02:00.67] And you'll be safe under my control
[02:03.46] Just let me in, ooh"
[02:13.46] 
[02:16.16] Just let me in, ooh
[02:25.66] 
[02:20.42] Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
[02:26.04] Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[02:32.82] Everything you want in gold
[02:35.68] I'll be the magic story you've been told
[02:38.91] And you'll be safe under my control
[02:41.55] Just let me in, ooh
[02:51.05] 
[02:45.78] Follow everywhere I go
[02:48.03] Top of all the mountains or valley low
[02:51.29] Give you everything you've been dreaming of
[02:54.25] Just let me in, ooh
[03:03.75] 
[02:58.66] Then she ran faster and
[03:01.91] Start screaming, "Is there someone out there?
[03:05.28] Please help me"
[03:06.87] Just let me in, ooh
